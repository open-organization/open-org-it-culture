# The Open Organization Guide to IT Culture Change

## Purpose

The open organization community at Opensource.com is preparing a new volume in the [_Open Organization_ book series](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources).

This volume will highlight the intersection of issues related to organizational culture, open organizational models, and agility-focused management paradigms in IT shops (e.g., scrum, agile, DevOps, etc.). The book should serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in the ways that buidling team cultures on open principles can help people address digital transformation and rethink their IT organizations.

## Background

The open organization community has contributed markedly to ongoing conversations about the ways that open principles will continue to transform traditional IT strategies, organizations, and practices. We can collect our IT-focused content—and solicit additional content that expands on it—into a downloadable and print-on-demand resource. As much as possible, we'll develop it using open methods and open tools. We do believe it might be the first book created according to the [Open Decision Framework](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-decision-framework)!

Our vision is a volume divided into two principal sections: One focused on "culture" and one focused on "skills." Each section would itself feature a custom-written introduction commissioned specifically for the book, as well as a specialized set of discussion questions, key takeaways, and management tips for anyone wishing to treat the volume like a handbook during change management efforts.

## Contributing
